    <h2>I make music</h2>
    <p>I've been playing guitar for about 10 years, starting on 6 and now playing exclusively on 7 and 8 strings guitars. I've recorded several EPs and albums with different bands in different styles (but always around metal). I am also learning to play classical piano.</p>
    <p>Since I moved to Paris I am not playing live anymore and some of my bands have become "internet bands".</p>
    <p>You can listen to most of the songs I made on <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/romainberger">Dailymotion</a> or download them for free on <a href="https://romainberger.bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a>. I also have a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/romainbergerband">Facebook</a> and a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/romainberger">Soundcloud page</a>.</p>

        <h4><a href="http://suicidalmassac.re" title="Suicidal Massacre">Suicidal Massacre</a></h4>
        <p>Suicidal Massacre begun as a joke (hence the stupid name), but people liked it, so it became a real band. The basic idea was to record brutal death core to warm up while we were recording Sihtu's album "V.I.T.R.I.O.L.". We released an album "Let The Massacre Begin" in may 2010, including a featuring with Cameron "Big Chocolate" Argon (Disfiguring the Goddess). In 2014 we've released an EP "Architect Of Annihilation" including a featuring with Julian Truchan (<a href="http://brutalbenighted.com/" target="_blank">Benighted</a>), produced by Taylor Voeltz (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/SoundsLikeRobotsFighting" target="_blank">Sounds Like Robots Fighting</a>) in Hollywood, CA.</p>

        <p>An "studio band" as we're not playing live. We are currently composing the first EP. This project is just for fun as I like playing fast and technical stuff.</p>

        <h4><a href="http;//sihtu.com" title="Sihtu">Sihtu</a></h4>
        <p>Created in 2007, we released a demo then an album "V.I.T.R.I.O.L." in 2009. We always defined the style as "experimental metal" as we're just trying to play with new sounds and rythm patterns. We are currently writing an EP. And if you're wondering, "Sihtu" is mesopotamian for Mercury. It does not have a particular sense to us, it just looks cool when it's written.</p>
