<h2>I make music</h2>
<p>I've been playing guitar for about 9 years, shredding on 6, 7 and 8 strings guitars. I've recorded several EPs and albums with different bands in different styles (but always around metal).</p>
<p>Since I moved to Paris I am not playing live anymore and some of my bands have become "internet bands".</p>

	<h4><a href="http://suicidalmassac.re" title="Suicidal Massacre">Suicidal Massacre</a></h4>
	<p>Suicidal Massacre begun as a joke (hence the stupid name), but people liked it, so it became a real band. The basic idea was to record brutal death core to warm up while we were recording Sihtu's album "V.I.T.R.I.O.L.". We released an album "Let the massacre begin" in may 2010, and we are currently working on the next one.</p>

	<p>An "studio band" as we're not playing live. We are currently composing the first EP. This project is just for fun as I like playing fast and technical stuff.</p>

	<h4><a href="http;//sihtu.com" title="Sihtu">Sihtu</a></h4>
	<p>Created in 2007, we released a demo then an album "V.I.T.R.I.O.L." in 2009. We always defined the style as "experimental metal" as we're just trying to play with new sounds and rythm patterns. We are currently writing an EP. And if you're wondering, "Sihtu" is mesopotamian for Mercury. It does not have a particular sense to us, it just looks cool when it's written.</p>

	<p>I also like playing instrumental music. I recorded several songs and played live on a festival, sharing the stage with Steve Lukather and Patrick Rondat.</p>
