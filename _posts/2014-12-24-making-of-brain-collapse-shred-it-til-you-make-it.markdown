## Mixing

All guitars plugged directly into the POD, just a little impulse and some EQ with Izotope Alloy. Some reverb and delays here and there, nothing more.

Drums are mixed with a parallel compression.

The mastering basically consist in a small compression, some EQ and a limiter. Yeah I suck at mastering.
