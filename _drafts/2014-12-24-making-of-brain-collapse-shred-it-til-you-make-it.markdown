## Gear used on the EP

- Jackson Soloist SLAT3 7. Standard tuning one step down
- POD HD Pro
- Bass: custom Elkine 6 strings bass + Aguilar amp
- Superior Drummer 2.0 + Metal Foundry + custom kick sample
- Other: orchestral EWQLSO Gold Library
- Recorded, mixed and mastered with Ableton Live 8 with some Yamaha HS50M

## Mixing

All guitars plugged directly into the POD, just a little impulse and some EQ with Izotope Alloy. Some reverb and delays here and there, nothing more.

Drums are mixed with a parallel compression.
