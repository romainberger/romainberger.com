# Circa 2009

Recording vocals for the first Sihtu EP. Sadly I have no trace of this EP but it was a 4 tracks (I think) demo we've made to find other people to join the band. I played and recorded all guitars and bass, and programmed all drums. The vocals was recorded with a sm58. Everything was plugged straight into a Line 6 Toneport ux2, going through GearBox. I had no idea what to do to mix so as far as I recall it was just leveling the volumes and maybe some EQ. I had no idea how a compressor or a limiter works so I didn't put anything on the master, which was clipping as hell.
I had no studio monitor so the output of my computer was going to my hifi to use its speakers.

- crappy computer running windows xp
- ableton live
- ez drummer with drumkit from hell
- line 6 toneport ux 2. everything recorded through this: guitars, bass, vocals
- crappy hi-fi monitors. They had a terrible frequency response (you could pretty much hear nothing below 80h)
- on the photo, we can see in the back a cardboard of my randy rhoads

A few month later this computer died and I lost pretty much all music I had on this (which is why I don't have this ep anymore).

# Circa 2010

A few month later, recording for the first Suicidal Massacre album. After the computer death I quickly switched for an imac. I then later got some yamaha monitor, the same I still use. At this point I kinda new what a compressor and limiter was so I could compress vocals and bass. I remember creating the snare sound by simply making it clip like crazy then limiting it. This is the source of its distorted sound, we thought it was cool at that time. I didn't know how to make subdrop (but it was the thing to use if you wanted to appear angry) so I would put explosion samples instead. I had a couple of mics then: a sm57 and a sm7b. We recorded vocals with the sm7b, and bass with both mics put at a different positions on the bass amp.

Sometimes I would try to record guitars with my Laboga amp. I would set everything in my room right next to the computer so I could have access to the head to tweak the sound. Later I made a long amp cable so I could put the head in my room and the cab in the hallway. I would put a mic in the center of a speaker and the other at the edge. Then put a blanket over the cab and mic to prevent reverb from the hallway. For Suicidal Massacre I chose to use the sound from Gearbox as it was easier and took less time to record (and I could plug and record, as I was living with my parents and couldn't record a tube amp when they were home).
